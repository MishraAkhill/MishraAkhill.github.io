                    <h3>Delhi to Tungnath - A Journey of Surprises and Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Day 1: </p>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My first bike trip was a whirlwind of excitement and anticipation. As I set off at 5:30 am on October 21st, a million questions swirled in my head: Would the roads be good? Would I find fuel and accommodation easily? Would I be able to stick to the plan?

                    My first bike trip was a whirlwind of excitement and anticipation. As I set off at 5:30 am on October 21st, a million questions swirled in my head: Would the roads be good? Would I find fuel and accommodation easily? Would I be able to stick to the plan?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My cousin, my trusty companion on this adventure, and I were loaded up with our gear, ready to conquer the mountains. We had a pact: not to exceed 80kmph and to avoid riding at night.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Our first stop was "Cheetal Grand," where we devoured delicious aloo parathas and chai. Refueled, we hit the road again, the smooth highway stretching before us. We couldn't resist making multiple stops to capture the stunning scenery and savor refreshing sugarcane juice.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    However, time slipped away faster than we realized. By the time we reached Rishikesh, it was 1:30 pm. We were behind schedule, and a pang of annoyance settled in. A much-needed lunch break at 2:30 pm helped us recharge and refocus.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Leaving Rishikesh, we finally embraced the mountains. The scenery was breathtaking: winding roads, towering peaks, and a sense of serenity that washed over us. We braved the occasional landslide-affected sections, marveling at the resilience of the mountains.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Our next stop was Devprayag, the confluence of the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers. The sight of the blue and brown waters merging, the bustling crowds, and the air of reverence left us speechless.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Though it was 5:45 pm, we knew we wouldn't reach Chopta by nightfall. Reluctantly, we switched to our backup plan â€“ reaching Rudraprayag by day's end. But before that, we indulged in a cup of steaming tea in Kullhad on the mountainside, the deliciousness magnified by the spectacular view.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    By 6:00 pm, darkness had descended. Riding without streetlights and fencing was nerve-wracking, but our determination to reach Rudraprayag kept us going. We cruised at a cautious 40kmph, finally reaching our destination at 8:30 pm.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Dinner at Shangrila Resort was the perfect reward for a long day. As we laid our heads to rest, I couldn't help but smile. Despite the challenges, Day 1 had been an amazing journey, filled with breathtaking sights and the thrill of the open road.
                    <br />
                    <br />
